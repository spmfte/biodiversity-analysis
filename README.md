# biodiversity-analysis
A data analysis project on endangered species in US National Parks. Investigating patterns in conservation status, using Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided by the National Parks Service and consists of two CSV files:

1. `species_info.csv`: Contains information on different species, including their scientific names, common names, and conservation statuses.
2. `observations.csv`: Contains data on the number of observations of each species in different National Parks.

## Tools and Libraries

The analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter Notebook, along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Getting Started

To run the analysis, you'll need to have Python, Jupyter Notebook, and the required libraries installed. You can use Anaconda to set up a virtual environment with all the necessary dependencies.

Once you have the environment set up, clone this repository and open the Jupyter Notebook file `biodiversity.ipynb` to start the analysis.
